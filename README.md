The developed algorithm is specific to the problem posed for assignment 1 of Research Track I course. The corresponding flow chart is:

The algorithm allows to robot to collect all the markers near a chosen one. Possible improvements may involve the trajectory computation to minimize the angles adjustment and overshoot of target markers.
