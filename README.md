The developed algorithm is specific to the problem posed for assignment 1 of Research Track I course. The corresponding flow chart is:

The algorithm allows to robot to collect all the markers near a chosen one using 5 main functions. Possible improvements may involve the trajectory computation to minimize the angle adjustments and overshoot of target markers or the implementation of a function to avoid collision with blocks
